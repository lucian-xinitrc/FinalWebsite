# Final Website

## $ intro
During my first year of high school, I was determined to explore the field of IT by recreating well-known apps, such as Tic-Tac-Toe and pocket-calculator. I didn’t limit myself strictly to JavaScript; I also used C#, intentionally overcomplicating simple tasks as an exercise. Hope you enjoy!

## $ features
The project is structured into:
- **Download Page**: The download page allows users to download a calculator zip file, also includes details and links to the other pages.
- **Tic-Tac-Toe Games**: Includes interactive Tic-Tac-Toe games (classic one and the beta version, 6x6).

## $ languages used
The website was built using the following technologies:

![HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C#, Vim](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=html,css,javascript,cs,sublime,visualstudio)


## $ installation and usage
- Clone or download the repository.
- Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to explore the website.
- Visit the download page to access the calculator zip file (there is not yet the Tic-Tac-Toe game).
- Play the Tic-Tac-Toe games directly on the website.
